## Why did I make this?

Roughly 3 months ago, I started building tastebuds. However I was unaware of what Spotify had been plotting under the hood. They made it such that no more can indie developers use their API in any meaningful way. I had still built this for their API. However, I felt discontent, because you couldn't use my project. I renamed that project to [`spotbuds`](https://github.com/kkrishguptaa/spotbuds) and set out to build tastebuds once again!

I also wanted to check out SolidJs and if it was truly much different from React, so I built this in Solid, even though it doesn't need a much of reactivity anyway. Every component of spotbuds has been rewritten apart from the prompt and the styles. They have simply been tweaked and improved on.
